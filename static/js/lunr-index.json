[{"title":"Backend","href":"/developer/backend","content":" Backend setup Server Vanilla works with Apache nginx our preference or IIS with proper configuration The core team does not officially support IIS but accept bug reports and patches related to it Apache Vanilla includes an htaccess file for outofbox Apache support You may need to edit the htaccess file as indicated for subfolder usage Obviously htaccess files must be enabled for your web root nginx The key to specifically running Vanilla under nginx is getting the basic rewrite rule in nginxconf correct These are by no means complete conf files nor an nginx tutorial these are simply excerpts of the Vanillaspecific rules needed An example of Vanilla 22 and earlier running in the root web folder location site rewrite indexphppuriargs last location tryfiles uri site An example of Vanilla 22 and earlier in a subfolder location subfolder tryfiles uri subfolder location subfolder rewrite subfolder subfolderindexphpp1args last In Vanilla 23 these rules change because the p parameter has been removed in favor of strict usage of PATHINFO and therefore no rewrite is needed However its important that your fastcgi params are setup to pass this information to PHP IIS We do not officially support this server but information and help may be provided on our community forumhttpsvanillaforumsorgdiscussions We welcome additions to this documentation Caching OPcache OPcache replaced APC as the preferred opcode caching solution for PHP as of 55 Vanilla is compatible with OPcache and no additional configuration is necessary beyond simply enabling it Memcached Vanilla has support for both Memcache and Memcached but we strongly recommend Memcached if you have an option It does require additional configuration beyond installing and enabling it in PHP ConfigurationCacheEnabled true ConfigurationCacheMethod memcached ConfigurationmemcachedStore localhost You can also specify a port for memcached Store eg localhost11211 Lastly you can optionally set Memcached options directly in your Vanilla config Here are some example settings you may wish to use Note that

confconfigdefaultsphp which we will call configdefaults After installation a file is created at confconfigphp which we will call simply config or configphp Your configdefaults file should never be edited It is overwritten during every upgrade Sometimes future changes may depend on your default configuration being changed and this is the mechanism thru which it will happen All configuration changes are to be exclusively made to your configphp file We recommend periodically making a backup copy of your configphp and storing it in a safe location not on your web server Editing configuration php php Config file entries look like this ConfigurationAreaFeatureSetSetting Value Config entires must render as valid PHP code so the placement of quotes brackets and semicolons is extremely important Line order does not matter unless you accidentally duplicate values which should be avoided In that case the last duplicate would take precedence Some scenarios for editing your config You want to change a config setting so you simply change Value on 1 line You want to change a default so you copy a line from configdefaults into config then modify its value You want to add a new config value entirely so you enter it using the format indicated above on a new line in the config Avoiding accidental overwrites Only open or copy your config for editing after you have applied or saved your latest settings in the Dashboard and wait until you are done editing to make further changes to your site Saving your config will overwrite any changes you may have made elsewhere at the same time Shorthand references When we talk about config lines we use the following shorthand AreaFeatureSetSetting Value php php The shorthand written using the full formatting

save small amounts of data to the config and it should not be data that is changed frequently If you have large quantities of data or data that is written frequently consider using the databasedevelopersframeworkdatabase instead Reading from config The c function is the appropriate shortcut for reading from the config The first parameter is the name of the config value in dot notationdevelopersconfiguration The second is an optional default value to return if requested config setting is not defined Example Value cNameOfSetting DefaultValue You can call a partial config key to get an array of all values below it in dot notation For instance say this was in your config php ConfigurationExampleSettingsA 1 ConfigurationExampleSettingsB 2 Now calling cExamplesSettings will return arrayA1 B2 Writing to config Save to the config with the SaveToConfig function It takes the name of the config value a new value to associate with it and an optional options array In the options array you can pass the key Save with the value FALSE to make the config change only apply for this pageload Change a config setting permanently SaveToConfigNameOfSetting NewValue Change a config setting only for this pageload SaveToConfigNameOfSetting NewValue arraySave FALSE Simply passing the value FALSE in place of the options array has the same effect as passing arraySave FALSE Do not used numerickey arrays as config values Associative arrays are fine Configuration module Weve created a shortcut for making simple settings pages using the ConfigurationModule The configuration

httpsgithubcomphpfigfigstandardsblobmasteracceptedPSR1basiccodingstandardmd PSR2 httpsgithubcomphpfigfigstandardsblobmasteracceptedPSR2codingstyleguidemd 1 Overview Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting not tabs Opening braces for classes and functions SHOULD be on the same line Control structure keywords MUST have one space after them method and function calls MUST NOT Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line and closing braces MUST go on the next line after the body Opening parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space after them and closing parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space before There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length the soft limit MUST be 120 characters lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less Namespace is not required Files MUST use only php tag Files MUST use only UTF8 without BOM for PHP code Files SHOULD either declare symbols classes functions constants etc or cause sideeffects eg generate output change ini settings etc but SHOULD NOT do both Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators Method names SHOULD be declared in camelCase View files are excluded from this standard You SHOULD try to follow as many rules as possible PSR1 httpsgithubcomphpfigfigstandardsblobmasteracceptedPSR1basiccodingstandardmd 11 Example This example encompasses some of the rules below as a quick overview php b foobararg1 else BazClassbararg2 arg3 return true 2 General 21 Files All PHP files MUST use the Unix LF linefeed line ending

possible 22 PHP Tags PHP code MUST use the long tags it MUST NOT use the other tag variations 23 Character Encoding PHP code MUST use only UTF8 without BOM 24 Side Effects A file SHOULD declare new symbols classes functions constants etc and cause no other side effects or it SHOULD execute logic with side effects but SHOULD NOT do both The phrase side effects means execution of logic not directly related to declaring classes functions constants etc merely from including the file Side effects include but are not limited to generating output explicit use of require or include connecting to external services modifying ini settings emitting errors or exceptions modifying global or static variables reading from or writing to a file and so on The following is an example of a file with both declarations and side effects ie an example of what to avoid php php side effect change ini settings iniseterrorreporting EALL side effect loads a file include filephp side effect generates output echo n declaration function foo function body The following example is of a file that contains declarations without side effects ie an example of what to emulate php Nb Using only spaces and not mixing spaces with tabs helps to avoid problems with diffs patches history and annotations The use of spaces also makes it easy to insert finegrained subindentation for interline alignment 27

the opening brace The structure body MUST be indented once The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces This standardizes how the structures look and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors as new lines get added to the body 51 if elseif else An if structure looks like the following Note the placement of parentheses spaces and braces and that else and elseif are on the same line as the closing brace from the earlier body php php if expr1 if body elseif expr2 elseif body else else body The keyword elseif SHOULD be used

When doing so the first item in the list MUST be on the next line and there MUST be only one argument or variable per line When the ending list whether or arguments or variables is split across multiple lines the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them The following are examples of closures with and without argument lists

Swifthttpsswiftorgcontributing because they are awesome Reporting issues like a pro First check for duplicates by searching on GitHub All clear Then make sure you cover three points A concise description of the problem If the issue is a fatal error include a debug trace Otherwise describe the behavior you were expecting to see along with the behavior you actually observed A reproducible test case If you need to include a lot of code to do this make a gist on GitHub and link it Include the precise Vanilla version number and any relevant system information ex OS PHP version settings MySQL settings Triaging issues There are a number of things you can do to help triage issues in the issue tracker Reproduce it For a bug to be actionable it needs to be reproducible If you cant reproduce the bug try to figure out why Get in touch with the submitter if you need more information Reduce bugs Once a bug can be reproduced reduce it to the smallest amount of code possible Reasoning about a sample that reproduces a bug in just a few lines of Swift code is easier than reasoning about a longer sample Eliminate duplicates If two bug reports refer to the same underlying problem mark the newer one as a duplicate of the older one Doing so allows others to work more effectively"},{"title":"Pull Requests","href":"/developer/contributing/pull-requests","content":" Using pull requests to contribute code We love pull requests Theyre the core of our workflow All code is added to Vanilla via pull requests PRs A pull request is simply a request to merge code from a

performance and utilize caching if its available Building queries The SQL object supports chaining You can call it with Gdnsql Heres a simple example that gets a single discussion by its ID We write its pieces in the order of a SQL statement but they can be called in any order up to the get The get is the call that fires the built query Gdnsql select fromDiscussion whereDiscussionID DiscussionID

autoincrementing column The Gender column uses an array to create an enum type the rest are selfexplanatory The set method takes 2 parameters which should nearly always be false which is their default

pluggable platform on which to build all the addons that make Vanilla awesome The design of its database handling was influenced by CodeIgniter but its plugin architecture is pretty unique Technically Vanilla is a forum application addon built on top of the Garden framework However we typically refer to the entire stack as Vanilla for branding consistency and simplicity including in these docs If we had it all to do over we would just call the whole thing Vanilla and name the forum application Forum But now were stuck with GDN prefixes all over the place cest la vie The framework is a secondary concern to the forum In practice this means if you request an enhancement or find a bug in a framework piece that isnt used anywhere in the forum wed love a pull request but its unlikely well devote developer time to it Time is precious and were building awesome forums not CodeIgniter 2 or whatever the hip kids are using these days Addons are everything Addons are the most important feature of the framework Our crown jewel the Vanilla forum itself is technically an addon There are many ways for addons to hook into each other and were constantly refining their integration There are 4 types of addons Themes Plugins Applications Locales In the future we plan to combine applications and plugins to simplify things In the meantime the primary difference between them is that applications can use native controllers more easily making more complex software a little less messy to navigate However as of 23 plugins will be able to use native controllers Themes have the full power of plugins via their hooks file but we suggest only using it for aesthetic changes File structure The core framework files are located in librarycore The database layer is contained in librarydatabase and thirdparty libraries are in libraryvendors All our junk is in trunk Our frameworks frontend is built on Javascript and jQuery jQuery files and plugins are in jslibrary while files in the root js folder are custom to our framework Common subfolders in addons will include design CSS and images js modules views and settings structure and config Nonview PHP files are named in the format typenamephp Type is one of class functions or interface We do not rename thirdparty files included in Vanilla Classes in addons nearly always inherit from one or more framework classes Default applications Three applications come preinstalled enabled by default Dashboard Vanilla and Conversations On a technical level Vanilla is simply a Garden addon that works in concert with others to create your forum experience The Vanilla application is only responsible for discussions comments and categories The Dashboard application powers your Dashboard UI users roles activity and much of the core functionality used by a memberdriven website The Conversations application powers private messaging To disable private messaging simply disable the Conversations application If you just want to use the Garden framework you could theoretically disable all the core Applications and roll your own from scratch In reality we recommend always at least using Dashboard Even if youre not building a forum with Garden its definitely built with a usercentric website in mind Let the code guide you Because so much is possible with the framework it can be intimidating to get started Our best advice is look at an existing plugin that does something close to what youre attempting to see how they do it Code examples can guide you to new solutions you didnt know were possible The Skeleton application in applicationsskeleton is heavily documented inline to help you get started Make a copy and get coding but remember forgetting to delete the extraneous docs is like leaving the price tag on your clothes Well judge you Where to start Not sure what doc to read next We recommend reading the plugin quickstartdeveloperspluginsquickstart then try Controllerdevelopersframeworkcontrollers and

Messages","href":"/developer/framework/inform","content":" Inform Messages Inform Messages allow you to let users know of some action that your plugin or application has taken Inform messages allow you to quickly and easily relay information to users and handle actions based on interaction with those messages Use them freely to notify users of saved forms punishments rewards etc You can send Inform Messages from within a controller or a plugin or from a custom javascript function By default these messages are stackable dismissable and autodismissable They can contain any plaintext string or any unfiltered custom html string They can be passed with JavaScript callbacks to fire on dismissal so some kind of further action can be taken There are even CSS definitions that allow you access to over 100 readymade icon sprites you can use to denote meaning in your messaging Using in core An example native inform message in Vanilla saving drafts When a comment draft is saved you can see an inform message appear on the bottomleft of the screen This message shows a close button on the topright when you hover your mouse overtop and it automatically disappears after a few seconds The code used to make this message appear is located on line 448 of applicationsvanillaclasspostcontrollerphp thisgtInformMessagesprintfTDraft saved at s GdnFormatDate If we didnt want to include the time that the draft was saved we could simplify it further to thisgtInformMessageTDraft saved successfully The t function is Vanillas native Translate function so that the string can be converted to other languages Using in a plugin Adding a message to the screen with a plugin The code to achieve this is pretty easy public function BaseRenderBeforeSender SendergtInformMessageThis is a test With this code the message will appear on every page load for every user signed in or not and it will disappear after a few moments Not exactly a useful message but lets see what else we can do with it public function BaseRenderBeforeSender Only show the message if the user is signed in if GdnSessiongtIsValid SendergtInformMessageThis is a test Dismissable Now the message only shows if the user has a valid session and it doesnt autodismiss The second parameter in the InformMessage method is either a string of CSS classes to be applied to the message container or an array of options If you dont provide the second parameter at all it defaults to Dismissable AutoDismiss which obviously makes it so the message automatically disappears after a few moments or can be immediately dismissed by clicking the close button If you decide to use the second parameter here are the options available to you CssClass An optional set of css classes to pass along to the messages container DismissCallback An optional javascript callback that gets called when the close button is clicked on a message DismissCallbackUrl An optional javascript callback url that gets requested when the close button is clicked on a message If a dismissCallback is specified this option will be ignored Static messages Lets say you want to deliver a message to a particular user and have that message stay on the screen on every page load until that user dismisses the message You can achieve it like this public function BaseRenderBeforeSender Session GdnSession if SessiongtIsValid ampamp SessiongtUsergtUserID 1 ampamp SessiongtGetPreferenceUserDismissedCustomMessage false false SendergtInformMessage This message will stay here until you dismiss it array CssClass gt Dismissable DismissCallbackUrl gt plugindismissmessage Handle the callbackpublic function PluginControllerDismissMessageCreateSender Session GdnSession SessiongtSetPreferenceUserDismissedCustomMessage TRUE This message appears for me because my UserID is 1 and it keeps showing up on every page until I dismiss it At that point the callback url is requested via ajax and the dismissal preference is saved so the message will no longer appear for me Styling a message Lets look at how we can change the appearance of these messages There are over 100 icons available for you to use You can check them out by looking at the icon sprite file located in applicationsdashboarddesignimagesinformspritespng and you can see how to reference them by searching for the css definitions in applicationsdashboarddesignstylecss hint search for spanInformSprite Heres the code to achieve this message SendergtInformMessageltspan classInformSprite Skullgtltspangt This is a test Dismissable HasSprite Note the span at the front of the message This will contain the Skull image you see above Its also necessary for the CSS definition in the second argument to contain HasSprite so that the spacing amp alignment of the icon all works properly Message origin You can also style the inform messages to appear From a specific user Youll need to load a user record for the icon you wish to display and then write the message to the screen like this User GdnUserModelgtGet1 Load the user whos icon you want to showString UserPhotoUser Icon IMPORTANT Give the icon a css class of Icon String This is a test Append some messageSendergtInformMessageString Dismissable HasIcon Send to the screen Inform via JavaScript At some point you may need to write a message to the screen from JavaScript instead of from the server side This can be achieved with a similar JavaScriptbased method gdninformMessageThis is a test And all of the same properties exist so you can be as elaborate as you like gdninformMessageThis is a test CssClass Dismissable DismissCallback somefunction DismissCallbackUrl relativepathtocallbackurl Duplication and stacking You can add as many messages to as many pages as you like If a message is

Validation","href":"/developer/framework/models","content":" Models Datasetsframeworkdatasets Controllersframeworkcontrollers Viewsframeworkviews The theory of a Model in MVC is that it is an object representation of the data being manipulated In Garden however the actual object representation of the data comes from the DataSet class in the form of a php stdClass So as you may have guessed already in Garden the model isnt a representation of the data In Garden a model relates directly to a table and with the help of the database object allows you to retrieve information from the table enforce the schema of that table on the data being manipulated and put data into the table The real power of the Model class in Garden comes from its ability to examine the table from which it was created and understand the data types and requirements for putting data into that table When combined with Gardens Validation and Form classes it allows you to create forms with validation already built in The Model class itself is quite simple and can be used on any table in the database Lets take a look at a very basic example of how a model could be used to get some data from a database validate data and update data php Create a validation object to handle validation issues that the model will encounter Validation new GdnValidation Create a new model based on a table in the database called Blog BlogModel new GdnModelBlog Validation Retrieve a DataSet from the Blog table BlogData BlogModelGetWherearrayBlogID 12 Grab the first row of the dataset as an associative array Blog BlogDataFirstRow DATASETTYPEARRAY Blog now contains every column of the Blog table where BlogID 12 Lets change something BlogTitle Some blog title And save it BlogModelSaveBlog Validates And lets try to insert something that we know shouldnt go into the database BlogBlogID Not an Integer And save it BlogModelSaveBlog Doesnt validate When the models GetWhere method is called it does a very simple select from Blog where BlogID 12query that returns all of the columns from that table into a dataset At this point the model still doesnt know anything about the structure of the table When the models Save method is called the first thing it does is uses the Database object to get information about the table so that it can define the tables schema It looks at each columns data types isnullable default values keys etc Then it uses the validation object to build up a set of rules for each column Finally it examines the Blog that was passed as its first argument matching up associative array keys with column names and then checks each field against the rules automatically defined for that table As it encounters problems it builds up a set of validation results that can then be used however you wish typically they are consumed by Gardens form object and displayed on the screen So with just a few lines of code Ive grabbed data from the database altered it and saved it making sure that no invalid data is inserted into the database all exceptions are caught and results can be delivered to the user php printrBlogModelValidationResults Prints Array BlogID Array 0 ValidateInteger This means that the BlogID field has encountered a problem when attempting to validate that the BlogID value was an integer If there had been other errors for that column they would have also appeared for example php Empty value is also incorrect BlogBlogID BlogModelSaveBlog printrBlogModelValidationResults Prints Array BlogID Array 0 ValidateRequired 1 ValidateInteger The validation object will always collect as much information about what is wrong with the data as possible It is then up to the developer what to do with that information Luckily 99 of the time the developer will just let the Form handle the validation results Forms Validation In order for the database models validation datasets to shine we need to get the information out and editable by the users This is where the Form class comes into play Lets take a look at an actual example of how the controller model validator and form work together Lets say we get the following request bloggingtoolpostnew Which is the same as calling the following controller in an imaginary bloggingtool application PostNewMy New method on the post controller would contain php public function New Validation new GdnValidation BlogModel new GdnModelBlog Validation Set the BlogModel on the form thisFormSetModelBlogModel If the form has already been posted back if thisFormAuthenticatedPostBack Attempt to save the form values BlogID thisFormSave If it saved redirect to the new entry if BlogID FALSE RedirectbloggingtoolentriesBlogID Render the form thisRender The forms Save method calls the models Save and then takes any validation results that came out of it If the save was successful the model would have returned the id of the record inserted or updated If not it could take all of the validation results and write them to the screen for the user to see Thats really all there is to saving a bunch of data to the database You might be wondering What fields were actually savedThat all depends on what you put on the form The Form class is a user interface class which means that a large number of its methods actually return xhtml The view for my New method above would look something like this php echo thisFormOpen echo thisFormErrors echo thisFormTextInputTitle echo thisFormTextBoxBody echo thisFormCloseSave In this example you can see Ive referenced two fields on the Model that is being manipulated Title and Body When the forms Save method is called above and the Models Save method is called therein the model validates and attempts to save the data If one of these two fields were required it would return a validation result that would then be written to the screen by thisFormErrors Furthermore if there were a field on the Blog table that were required and not present on this form it would have a validation result for that as well What if we were editing a blog post instead of creating a new one php public function EditBlogID Validation new GdnValidation BlogModel new GdnModelBlog Validation Load the blog being edited Blog BlogModel GetWherearrayBlogID BlogID FirstRow Set the BlogModel on the form thisFormSetModelBlogModel Make sure the form knows which item we are editing thisFormAddHiddenBlogID BlogID If the form has NOT been posted back if thisFormAuthenticatedPostBack FALSE Set the blog on the form thisFormSetDataBlog else Attempt to save the form values BlogID thisFormSave If it saved redirect to the new entry if BlogID FALSE RedirectbloggingtoolentriesBlogID Render the form thisRender I load the blog and set its data onto the form using thisFormSetData At that point the form takes over and knows to either a render the existing data if the form has not been posted back or b render the postback data otherwise And since I added the BlogID to the forms hidden field collection the model will know that it should update a blog row instead of insert a new one"},{"title":"Modules","href":"/developer/framework/modules","content":"If controller methods

applicationsgardenviewsmodulesguestphp Modules are extended from the Module class which is like a very simple version of the controller class They are typically used to display information in the Panel asset but they can actually be used anywhere in the page A modules default asset is defined with the AssetTarget method which simply returns the name of the asset to add the module to by default Examples The simplest modules will have just two methods AssetTarget and ToString Lets make a Hello World module Create a file called classhelloworldmodulephp and place it in your test applications modules folder if you dont have a test application put it in Vanillas modules folder Open the file and enter the following class HelloWorldModule extends Module public function AssetTarget return Panel public function ToString return Hello World Now lets go add it to a controller Open up a controller in your test application and add the following if you dont have a test application use vanillas controllersdiscussionsphp file and add it to the bottom of the index method right above the call to thisgtRender thisgtAddModuleHelloWorldModule If you browse to this page the text Hello World will not appear in the panel You can change where the Hello World text appears either by changing the value returned by the AssetTarget method or on the fly when the module is added by the

moved over to the Content asset The AddModule method will take a string as the first parameter or an instantiated module object So we could have also added the module in the following manner

refactored out of the framework in the future However they are not forbidden and never will be Using Permissions There are two basic ways to check a permission One is to use a truefalse conditional typically to CheckPermission in an if statement if CheckPermissionPermissionName Do something special The other is to wholesale block execution by a call to GdnSessionPermission This method automatically triggers a permission exception public function Index GdnSessionPermissionPermissionName Do priviliged things safely now Typically we dont use the first convention to trigger a permission exception manually because the second will cover it Multiple Permissions You can use either method above to check multiple permissions by passing an array of permission names as the first parameter By default it will require ALL permissions named to pass If you pass a second parameter of false then only ONE of the permissions is needed to pass You may find additional permission checks in Vanilla for permission names that do not appear in the Dashboard using this style a normal permission name is passed in an array along with an invisible one This is to allow plugins to define the additional permissions for more granular checks if needed The Owner Flag The forum owners account the one you create when installing Vanilla gets a special flag set on it This is accomplished by setting the Admin column equal to 1 in the User table Accounts with this flag set bypass all permission checks CheckPermission will always return true and no permission exception will ever be thrown for it It will do this regardless of any role assignment For this reason it is extremely important to test your addons with a nonowner account to see your permission checks in action The System Flag The System account is generated for general use by addons and cases where content must be generated by the forum This account is designated by setting the Admin column equal to 2 in the User table This grants the same privileges as the Owner flag and protects the account from deletion or banning Reversed Permission A special case in the framework is the VanillaApprovalRequire permission It is checked with the CheckRequirement function A true result means their content must go to the Moderation queue for approval Therefore a true result actually grants you less permission We dont generally recommend using this construct"},{"title":"Requests","href":"/developer/framework/requests","content":" Requests Vanillas base Controller class the class from which all controllersdevelopersframeworkcontrollers are extended accepts a DeliveryType parameter on every request Depending on the type of delivery being requested a controller in Garden will deliver all of a page part of a page or part of a page plus extra information as JSON DeliveryType There are four delivery types available 1 DELIVERYTYPEALL Entire page default 2 DELIVERYTYPEASSET Content for the requested assetdevelopersframeworkassets 3 DELIVERYTYPEVIEW Only the requested viewdevelopersframeworkviews 4 DELIVERYTYPEBOOL Only report request success truefalse If no delivery type is provided in the request DELIVERYTYPEALL is assumed In order to made the controller deliver content other than DELIVERYTYPEALL you would have to append the request URL or post data with the DeliveryType parameter set to the above value you want A DELIVERYTYPEVIEW request can be easily used for progressive data loading That or a DELIVERYTYPEASSET request could be used to update part of a page A DELIVERYTYPEBOOL request is used for actions like closing a discussion DeliveryMethod The DeliveryMethod defines what format you want the response in 1 DELIVERYMETHODXHTML Delivered as HTML default 2 DELIVERYMETHODJSON As JSON 3 DELIVERYMETHODXML As XML 4 DELIVERYMETHODTEXT As textplain since 21 5 DELIVERYMETHODPLAIN No ContentType is set since 21 6 DELIVERYMETHODRSS An RSS feed since 21 Vanilla builds datasets for its pages in generic collections that can be output in any of the above formats assuming an appropriate view is available You can define a DeliveryMethod by appending it to your request like DeliveryType or by appending an extension to your request after the method For example try viewing profile on your forum vs profilejson Note that arguments are added normally after another slash Supposing you wanted to view userid 2s profile with the name Lincoln you would use profilejson2Lincoln Parsing Requests Vanilla parses incoming URLs and parameters for you There is rarely any reason to directly access PHP globals like GET The GdnRequest class in librarycoreclassrequestphp handles this for you Gdnrequestdomain will return the current domain These methods also work as youd expect Host IpAddress Path and Port You can also call Get and Post with a parameter name to see its current value See GdnRequest for more request data A few more useful methods Use GdnrequestisAuthenticatedPostback to check that the current user sent a POST request along with their TransientKey to protect against CSRF attacks All forms built with Vanilla include a TransientKey Use Gdnrequesturl to build safe URLs to other parts of Vanilla The url function is a shortcut to this method Use GdnrequestrequestMethod to find out which Vanilla method was called by the current request"},{"title":"Views","href":"/developer/framework/views","content":" Views Once a controller method is called to handle the request how is the xhtml of the page put together Views There are two types of views in Garden Views and Master Views A view relates directly to the controller method that called it and handles rendering content related to that request You can typically think of a view as the content for that page For example if a VanillaDiscussionAll method is called the view for that method would handle rendering all of the discussions Everything that is rendered around the discussions is handled by the Master View The Master View allows you to create a consistent layout for the pages in the application A single master view defines the look and feel and standard behavior for all of the pages or a group of pages in the application Lets go back to the filesystem so you can get a better picture In the following example the request in the url would have been httpmyservercomgardenprofileindexmark So this means that Gardens Profile controller was requested the index method was requested from the profile controller and the first argument into the index method is mark In other words the request was ProfileControllerIndexmark Lets take a look at the profile controllers index method php public function IndexUserReference UserModel new UserModel thisUser UserModelGetByReferenceUserReference thisRender Simply put the index method grabs some data that can be later used in the profile controllers index view and then calls the Render method The Render method is defined on the base Controller class the class from which all controllers are extended The Render method performs the following tasks 1 Finds and fetches the view 2 Finds and fetches the css for the view 3 Finds and renders the master view In the most simple example the view will be as it appears in the image above in a profile folder within the views folder and named after the method that was called viewsprofileindexphp By default the controller will fetch that view from the context of the FetchView method of the base controller class In plainEnglish the view file is included within a method on the Controller class called FetchView That is why I placed the user data within a thisUser property in my ProfileControllerIndex method above so it could be accessible from within my view file The view file likely will contain something as simple as this Basic Information Data Property Joined UserDateFirstVisit Visits UserCountVisits Last Active Once the view is fetched it is added to an asset collection By default it is added to the Content asset collection The rest of the page the Frame of the page is handled by the master view By default the defaultmaster master view is used unless another master view is specified In the image above you can see that there are a few different master views available in the Garden application default email error and setup The css files for each of those master views are named accordingly as well So the defaultmaster view has a defaultscreencss file the errormaster view has an errorscreencss file etc Again in the most simple of examples the master view is located in the view folder of the application and the related css files are located in the design folder of that application Here is what the defaultmaster view looks like php RenderAssetHead BodyIdentifier arrayclass thisCssClass As you can see the master view handles the basic structure of a page As I mentioned above by default the view that is fetched by the controller is added to an asset collection called Content and that asset collection is rendered in this master view when the thisRenderAssetContent method is called right there in the middle of the master view As you can see in the master view above there are a number of different asset collections available for application and plugin authors Head Menu Content and Foot An application author has the ability to add as many of these as heshe desires and add to them as necessary The idea behind these asset collections is that while the basic request can be handled and placed into the Content asset ie the profile information being displayed from the example above there are still a lot of other elements a person may want on a page Plugin authors may want to add assets to the head menu or foot They may even want to add assets to the content collection Garden itself has other UI components that get rendered in the head and menu asset collections which will be discussed in a later preview So in the most basic example the index view is requested from its controllers view folder the defaultscreencss file is requested from the applications design folder and the master view is requested from the root of the applications view folder What other ways could the views and css have been retrieved The controller uses Gardens FileSystem object to search the application for the appropriate file to handle the request Whatever the filesystem object finds first it will use Views are retrieved with the following precedence 1 An explicitly defined path to a view ie a plugins custom view location 2 Applicationspecific theme view ie pathtogardenthemesthemenameappnameviewscontrollernameviewphp 3 Gardenwide theme view ie pathtogardenthemesthemenameviewscontrollernameviewphp 4 Application default ie pathtogardenapplicationsappnameviewscontrollernameviewphp Master views are retrieved with the following precedence 1 Applicationspecific theme view ie

pathtogardenapplicationsappnamedesigndefaultscreencss 4 Garden default ie pathtogardenapplicationsgardendesigndefaultscreencss You might be wondering things like can I change the view or master view that handles my request on the fly Of course you can Everything in Garden was written so that you have total control over what comes out on the other end In my example above I could change my views on the fly with something like this php public function IndexUserReference UserModel new UserModel thisUser UserModelGetByReferenceUserReference thisView somethingelse Use viewsprofilesomethingelsephp to handle the content or thisView someotherviewphp Use some custom view to handle the content thisMasterView setup Use the setup master view to render my contents thisRender Views are a lot to take in and they certainly might be daunting upon first read But I can guarantee that I have found them to be utterly simple and flexible to use Think of the possibilities you can accomplish with views You could create a master view that handles rendering of RSS feeds You could port your request method to use your RSS master and render all of your contents with a custom RSS view You could grab the email master view and send out your content to some email addresses before rendering You could bypass the rendering altogether and deliver json data The possibilities are endless and that is the real power of views"},{"title":"Building new porters","href":"/developer/importing/build","content":" Building a new porter file We dont support your forum Here are some tips for getting started rolling your own

forum 3 Import the Porter file in Vanillas Dashboard 4 Verify finalize your new forum Vanilla Porter requires a MySQL database and PHP 53 with zlib support enabled Before migrating We recommend these best practices 1 Inform your community well in advance about the coming transition Introduce them to Vanilla and communicate why you are migrating and when 1 If possible allow moderators time to use Vanilla and ask questions before migrating 1 Do one or more test runs to work out any issues and familiarize yourself with the process 1 Prepare test redirects from your old forums content to its new location This is important for search engine traffic preserving links between discussions and browser bookmarks More information about this is below under Special Steps Notes Doing these things will help your members moderators and yourself have a better migration experience and set good expectations for everyone All set OK lets jump in 1 Export old forum data Vanlla Porter exports from a database to a special Porter file format that Vanilla can import We currently support these platformsdevelopersimportingsupport If you have a very large forum millions of posts see the Special Steps Notes below before beginning To use it 1 Grab the export toolhttpvanillaforumsorgaddonportercore and unzip it It will be a single file named vanilla2exportphp 2 Upload the file to writable web directory on the server with your legacy database Most forums have a files or uploads directory which is an easy place to put it 3 Browse to vanilla2exportphp in your web browser You should see a Vanilla Porter web page 1 If this is the final export now is the time to put your legacy forum into readonly mode to prevent posts from being lost during the migration 4 Enter information about your forum database into the form and click Begin Export If you cant remember try looking at your forums configuration file 5 Download the Porter file it generates Got problems See the Troubleshooting section below 2 Create a new Vanilla forum In order to import your data you will need a fresh installation of Vanillahttpvanillaforumsorgaddonvanillacore When you do the import all data in your fresh installation will be overwritten so make sure you dont have any discussions you want to keep there See the README file for help 3 Import your data 1 Place your Porter file that the export created in Vanillas uploads folder 1 In Vanilla click Import in the Dashboard 1 Select the file you uploaded Enter the email of the user from your legacy forum you want to be the superadmin of the new forum Check Use my current password Leave the password box empty 1 Click Start Import 1 The import runs a while depending on how much data you have If its more than a million posts you can make a cup of tea and check Twitter 1 Click Finish to cleanup and finalize the import Welcome to Vanilla Notice you are now logged in as the username you entered The password is the one you created your Vanilla forum with Below are some more things you should do to get your new forum ready 4 Verifying finalizing the import These are things to do after your Vanilla import This includes manually visiting a few hidden Dashboard pages just for this process 1 Database Update Visit the URL utilityupdate to make any database changes needed An import can overwrite changes your addons made so they will be reapplied by this 1 Counters Update Visit the URL dbacounts to run counter updates of things like the number of discussions per category 1 Users View your Users page in the Dashboard to verify users were imported correctly and are all assigned to a role 1 Roles Permissions Many imports reset permissions It is very import you edit each role in turn to review and correct them 1 Default Roles Visit the URL roledefaultroles to make sure your visitor default and applicant roles are assigned correctly 1 Better BBCode If youre coming from a forum that uses BBCode we recommend grabbing the NBBC plugin from the Addons repositoryhttpsgithubcomvanillaaddons for improved support 1 Verify Content Go thru your discussions and categories to make sure your content is complete ungarbled and organized correctly 1 Enable Verify Redirects Turn on your 301 redirects to Vanilla Test old discussion category and user profile URLs to make sure you have set up your redirects correctly See the Redirects section below for more info Special Steps Notes This part contains nauseating levels of detail about aspects of migrating that hopefully you dont need to deal with Youll get referred here from elsewhere in the docs if you need it Large forums Forums with over 1 million posts may take a long time to migrate on lowbudget hosting plans and cause intense resource usage or downtime while it runs Forums with over 10 million posts make take a very long time cause strain on any hosting plan For advanced users in these circumstances copy your database to a localhost installation and run the Porter via the command line See the Vanilla Porter repository and READMEhttpsgithubcomvanillaporter for more information We likewise recommend importing to a localhost copy of Vanilla and running your verification finalization steps locally and repeating the Default Roles step after copying the database to production Attachments File attachments and avatars may be stored in the file system or as binary blobs in the database depending on your platform and configuration If they are stored in the file system most common copy the entire folder directly into Vanillas uploads folder The Porter can export binary blobs for vBulletin When navigating to the vanilla2exportphp file add avatars1files1 to the URL This will create folders for attachments and customavatars that should each be directly copied to Vanillas uploads folder To rename vBulletins attachments to have correct extensions use filepathpathtoattachments in the URL to process them Renaming phpBBs attachments requires the special utilitiesphpbbextensionsphp file in the repository These are currently advanced user tools and may require consulting the inline documentation in the appropriate package file If you get stuck ask on the community forumhttpvanillaforumsorgdiscussions NonMySQL data Data in nonMySQL formats MSSQL PostgreSQL XML CSV JSON should first be converted to a MySQL database before using Vanilla Porter or attempting to create a Porter package For flat file data we recommend a table per file Preserving existing column names is preferred whenever possible Passwords Vanilla natively supports many legacy password schemes for other forums This means users do not need to reset their password if youre coming from a platform we support see the vanilla2exportphp file for availability If you run into problems your platform isnt supported or want to reset them anyway you can run this SQL query via a tool like phpMyAdmin to reset all passwords update GDNUser set HashMethod Reset where Admin 1 the where clause there prevents resetting your superadmin password This does not trigger any notification emails users will be alerted they must reset their password on their next login attempt Redirects Many legacy platform redirects can be handled by the Redirector plugin in the Addons repositoryhttpsgithubcomvanillaaddons Simply enable the plugin Check the description for what it supports currently You can create custom redirects as needed using the Routesdevelopersroutes feature in the Dashboard Use regular expressions to match incoming URL patterns and 301 redirects to their new place Some imports will automatically create Routes for you so check to see If you run the import on localhost and then copy the database to production be sure to manually transfer those special Routes as well Once you have correct redirects set in Vanilla you must set up a global redirect from your old forum address to Vanilla See the forumredirector folder in the Addons repositoryhttpsgithubcomvanillaaddons for help setting this up This is not the same as the Redirector plugin above which is at pluginsRedirector Users hitting your old forum should then be 1 globally 301 redirected to Vanilla which will then 2 301 redirect to the correct content based on the URL requested Yes 2 redirects are used in this technique Troubleshooting Common problems using Porter 1 Not placing the file vanilla2exportphp in a webenabled folder accessible from the Internet 1 Not placing the file vanilla2exportphp in a folder that the web server has permission to write to 2 Attempting to export from an MSSQL database You must first convert to MySQL Try the dbdump toolhttpsgithubcomtburrydbdump 3 Attempting to export from a nonPHP server Try setting up a tool like MAMP or WAMP on your computer and copying your database there instead Still having trouble Ask on the community forumhttpvanillaforumsorgdiscussions Common problems while importing 1 Entering a user email address that does not exist in the legacy forum 2 Unzipping the generated porter file Leave it zipped and do not rename it 3 Not having zlib installed AND enabled in your PHP install Confirm this with your

without ever modifying its code Events Handlers Any class that extends the class Pluggable has the ability to call thisfireEventEventName and then plugins can attach to that event to perform an action There is a PluginManager that detects any enabled plugins When the FireEvent method is called it pings the PluginManager class to see if there are any plugins that want to attach to the event name being fired Plugins attach to an event by creating a method named with the object name event name and the word handler separated by underscores Say the DiscussionsController fired an event named Kaboom Here is how you would use it class MyPlugin extends GDNPlugin public function discussionsControllerkaboomhandlersender args Do stuff at the Kaboom event here senderindex You can invoke DiscussionsController methods here Notice that 2 parameters are passed The first is the object invoking the event usually this The second is optional and is an array of event arguments being passed as additional info or options to be modified EventArguments Usually these arguments are the data being set up by the object a toggle the handler can switch on or off or other contextual info For example thisEventArgumentsDuckDodgers 245 thisfireEventKaboom Now in our Handler method above args would be an array of DuckDodgers 245 If we set argsDuckDodgers 0 in our handler method it would also be changed back in the DiscussionsController because it was passed by reference To invoke a handler on ALL methods use the prefix base instead of an object name Example basekaboomhandler It is best to avoid unnecessary calls by using this very conservatively Custom events are added on a casebycase basis as the need arises If you feel you need a new event request it on the community forum Magic Events Magic events were an elaborate system of hook possibilities that involved the method prefix x and PHPs call method Currently there is only one undeprecated magic event in Vanilla renderbefore It invokes just before the page is rendered Example use baserenderbeforeSender It is best to avoid when another event is usable For a better alternative hook that reliably fires early on every request try gdndispatcherappStartuphandler instead To universally include a CSS file use assetModelstyleCsshandler Function Overrides All functions in the framework are declared like so if functionexistsfunctionName function functionName Do something Plugin authors may therefore override any core function simply by defining it in a plugin or theme hook file which are included before the core functions Magic Methods Magic methods allow you to create new methods and add them to existing objects They are created in much the same way that you plug into events Imagine you wanted to add a method named Kaboom to the DiscussionsController class MyPlugin extends GdnPlugin public function discussionsControllerkaboomcreateSender echo Kaboom With this plugin enabled going to the URL discussionskaboom would now output the text Kaboom You can references other methods and properties on the extended object using the Sender variable If you use a magic method to duplicate an existing method name it will be overridden completely And call to it will be directed to your plugin instead The only exception is the Index method Magic methods only work in classes that extend GdnPluggable For example notice the GdnForm class does but the GdnFormat class does not All models and controllers do Controllers Is your addon a bit more complex Add a controllers folder and add your own controller classes They will automatically be detected and be dispatched to like normal controllers This functionality is new in Vanilla 22 As a reminder controllers should extend GdnController Read more about controllersdevelopersframeworkcontrollers Virtual Controller deprecated A virtual controller let you simulate a single controller within a plugin First create a magic method using the namespace you want for your controller Example pluginControllernewNamespacecreate This creates content under the URL pluginnewnamespace To put NewNamespace as the first level instead of under plugins use the RootController End the magic method with a redispatch thisdispatchSender SenderRequestArgs Next create methods named ControllerX where X is the method namespace Example controllerindexSender Lets put it all together with a quick example Lets say you wanted to create content at fancyping This would accomplish that dispatchSender SenderRequestArgs Include param and return in your docs too public function controllerpingSender This is what happens when you call fancyping This is obviously more resourceintense than a normal controller so avoid this technique if normal controllers are

Drupal this might read like moonspeak Thats OK Soak it up and ask questions on the forum after you follow this guide and play with the examples Ready to code Grab the Example pluginhttpvanillaforumsorgaddonexampleplugin and use it below for an even quicker start Hang onto your butts here we go 1 Name your plugin 1 Define your plugin 1 Find your hooks 1 Write your code 1 Add helper files 1 Name your plugin Conventionally Vanilla uses well pretty vanilla plugin names We often favor descriptive names over clever ones or minibrands Your plugin needs a userfacing name and a slug name without spaces or special characters If your plugin is named Lincolns Fancy Plugin a good slug name would be LincolnsFancyPlugin or even just FancyPlugin 2 Define your plugin First create a folder in the plugin directory using the slug name you selected eg FancyPlugin Inside the folder create a file that includes the slug name eg classfancypluginphp Next open the file and add the plugin definition at the top like this Lincolnrsquos Fancy Plugin Description This is a sample plugin Version 10 Author Your Name AuthorEmail youyourdomaincom AuthorUrl httpyourdomaincom MobileFriendly TRUE The array key FancyPlugin above must exactly match the folder name including capitalization Define basic info The Name parameter is optional it will default to the slug if omitted To include special characters here or in the description use their HTML code Provide a great Description that briefly explains what your plugin does from the users perspective For Version familiarize yourself with semantic versioninghttpsemverorg The Author parameters are at your discretion We recommend using a support address for both the email and URL The MobileFriendly parameter allows the plugin to be automatically disabled when accessing the site via a mobile device We recommend defining it as TRUE If omitted it defaults to FALSE All further optional parameters described below default to FALSE if not defined Define a settings page To create a Settings button that will appear on the plugin after it is enabled add these to your definition SettingsUrl settingssomepagehere

Vanilla by adding this RequiredApplications arrayVanilla 2018 Require some other plugins to be enabled first in much the same way RequiredPlugins arrayAkismet 101 StopForumSpam 10 Note that this only requires them at the time of enabling A user could later disable the plugins Therefore it is very important to use defensive programming techniques to guard against missing prerequisites rather than simply assuming they will always be there just because you put it in the requirements Define new permissions Adding new permissions via plugin is easy Any defined here will be added as soon as the plugin is enabled Its important to know more about using permissions in Vanillahttpdocsvanillaforumscomdevelopersframeworkpermissions before doing this You can provide an array of permission names using dot syntax You can optionally use keyvalue pairs to set a default 1 will give all roles the permission 0 is the default and leaves it off for all roles to start RegisterPermissions

set good defaults while allowing them to be changed independently in the future Whew That whole definitions section probably didnt seem very quick but you just did a huge amount of work in just a few lines of code 3 Find your hooks Try the Eventi pluginhttpvanillaforumsorgaddoneventiplugin to visualize where events are fired in Vanilla Use the hooks in the Example pluginhttpvanillaforumsorgaddonexampleplugin to see what they do Read the plugin hooks tutorialdevelopersplugins for more on how to override extend Vanilla Use an IDE and use the project search functionality to locate instances of FireEvent in the core repohttpgithubcomvanillavanilla Many doc blocks show what events are fired within their methods Or search for Handler in the addons repohttpgithubcomvanillaaddons to see examples and common uses Lastly find a pluginhttpvanillaforumsorgaddon that does something similar to what youre trying to do and check out its code Maybe between 3 or 4 plugins you can find a good portion of what youre trying to accomplish 4 Write your code After your PluginInfo array youll need a class Always extend GdnPlugin and name the class using the slug name of your plugin followed by the word Plugin to avoid namespace conflicts class FancyPlugin extends GdnPlugin Inside the class give methods special names to invoke hooks Most hooks in a plugin are written like this public function SomeControllerSomeEventHandlerSender Args Do something Use the Sender variable to call methods from the controller or model that triggered your code Use the Args variable to change parameters or detect certain situations This is where youll want to start digging into the finer points of extending Vanilla with pluginsdevelopersplugins You can also use normal methods to reuse code For instance maybe you need 2 different hooks to do the same thing public function DiscussionsControllerSomeEventHandlerSender Args thisCommonMethodSender Args public function CategoriesControllerSomeOtherEventHandlerSender Args thisCommonMethodSender Args public function CommonMethodSender Args Do something for both the events above so we keep things DRY Need a simple settings page See the ConfigurationModule and how it is used in other plugins for a quick easy way of making one After your class you can define any functions from core that you wish to override Do

predefined default values Predefined Routes There are four predefined routes that have special meaning They are DefaultController This is the main page to load when the root url of your Vanilla installation is viewed Default404 The page to view when the requested url could not be found DefaultPermission The page to view when the user attempted to perform an action they didnt have permission for UpdateMode The page to view when Vanilla has been taken offline for maintenance DefaultController is the one you will most likely be working with the most and by default it is set to discussions with an internal route type which means that it will essentially be the same as sending the user to wwwyourdomaincompathtovanillarootdiscussions Custom Routes Custom routes allow you to create more userfriendly urls for commonly requested pages in your installation For example if you had a popular discussion at the following url httpyourdomaincomcommunitydiscussion1250hampstersgonnahampst You could create a route to this discussion by adding a new custom route with the following values Route Expression hamsters Target discussion12500hampstersgonnahamst Type internal With this route in place users will be able to get at your hamster discussion by going to httpyourdomaincomcommunityhamsters Your old URL will continue to work as well and this will not affect search engine ranking as we tell the search engines what the canonical url is for every page Google will treat duplicate routes to the same content as one page Route Types There are several different route types They are Internal Sends no additional headers with the request Temporary Sends a 302 header with the request telling search engines that the move is temporary and they should not update their indexes Permanent Sends a 301 header with the request telling search engines that the new page is now permanently at the new location and that they should update their indexes Not Found Sends a 404 header with the request telling search engines that the file was not found and to update their indexes accordingly Most of the time Internal will be the route type of choice Noninternal routes can take a full url including http as the target while internal routes can ONLY forward the user to a location within the application"},{"title":"Theming CSS","href":"/developer/theming/css","content":" Theming with CSS

looking to learn more about customizing CSS in our hosted product check out theme tips on our bloghttpsblogvanillaforumscomtagfridaytips Adding CSS to your theme There are two options for adding CSS to your theme in our open source version You can completely override the existing base CSS file stylecss or you can add an additional CSS file customcss that gets added after the base CSS file Especially for beginners or new Vanilla users adding an additional CSS file customcss is is often preferable to completely overriding the base CSS for a number of reasons 1 Support Any upgrades to the base CSS file will still be applied to your theme 2 Completeness There will still be styling applied to anything missed by your new CSS file 3 Clarity Its easier for you to see what your specific customizations to Vanilla are as they are selfcontained in customcss Adding additional CSS To add additional CSS to the existing base Vanilla CSS file 1 Create a new file called customcss 2 Place it in the design folder in your theme folder ie themesyourthemenamedesigncustomcss This CSS file is added after the base CSS file and all other plugin and applicationspecific CSS files Overriding the base CSS This option should be used only if you know what youre doing To completely override the existing base Vanilla CSS file 1 Create a new file called stylecss 2 Place it in the design folder in your theme folder ie themesyourthemenamedesignstylecss Starting from scratch can be a daunting task so you may want to copy the existing base CSS from applicationsdashboarddesignstylecss into your new stylecss file and then edit the existing CSS This CSS file is added before the plugin and applicationspecific CSS files You may still want a customcss file to override CSS rules in the plugin and applicationspecific CSS files Tips and troubleshooting Here are a few gotchas that can occur when styling Vanilla Layouts Vanilla offers either a HTML table layout or list layout for its Categories and Discussions listings This layout can be specified in the dashboards Homepage section Each layout has its own set of CSS classes so its best to decide which layout youd like to use before you start styling your theme Plugins Plugins have the ability to add CSS files to your forum or HTML elements to views As such enabling a plugin can sometimes mess with your forums CSS and layout To mitigate this its best to enable all the plugins you anticipate using while you work on your theme If you do enable a plugin and encounter some undesirable CSS side effects its good to know that your themes customcss file is added after the plugins CSS files so overriding the CSS rules defined in the plugins CSS should be a breeze Hiding content Using display none to hide elements on a page is often a good choice for removing content that is not valuable to you or your community However when doing so make sure to make the CSS rule as specific as possible For instance lets say you want to hide the discussions link in the side panel navigation on the Discussions page A very bad way to accomplish this would be by using the CSS rule css Discussions display none This rule will succeed in hiding the link but also the body of the Discussions page as the body element includes the Discussions CSS class A better safer rule would be css SectionDiscussionList FilterMenu Discussions display none SectionDiscussionList targets the discussion page FilterMenu targets a filtering menu and Discussions targets a specific list item in the menu This is much less likely to have undesired side effects"},{"title":"Theming Hooks","href":"/developer/theming/hooks","content":" Theming Hooks Themes can be imbued with the power of plugins via a special hooks php file Using the hooks file you can

core Vanilla As such your new view may not always be supported in future versions of Vanilla which may cause problems down the road If its possible to accomplish what youre trying to do using good ol CSS or themehooksthemingthemehooks or by being clever with the configuration of your master view those are probably better ways to go With that warning out of the way heres how you can override a view in Vanilla Some plugins and every application contains a views folder To override any file in this folder 1 Copy the view file from the source view folder 2 Place it in the view folder in your theme folder following the same file path ie copy the view from applicationsvanillaviewsdiscussionsindexphp to themesyourthemenameviewsdiscussionsindexphp Overriding helper functions Many views use helper functions to generate their markup This helper file can be overridden as well However most of the time youll only need to override one or two functions from this file Rather than overriding the entire file its better to override just the functions that you need to override To do this 1 Create a new file in your themes view folder following the same path as the source helper functions file 2 Copy the functions you want to override into this new file 3 Add a include statement to the source helper functions file for example php includeonce PATHAPPLICATIONSvanillaviewsdiscussionshelperfunctionsphp or php includeonce PATHPLUGINSReactionsviewsreactionfunctionsphp Heres an example of a file that changes the heading of the discussion column in a discussion table from Discussion to the name of the parent category It overrides the applicationsvanillaviewsdiscussionshelperfunctionsphp view php dataCategoryName TDiscussion endif includeonce

used when you want to take one existing Vanilla forum instance and merge it into another existing Vanilla forum Core Vanilla data in addition to some plugin and addon data will be carried over from the source into the destination forum and reconciled with existing records to avoid conflicts What Data is Merged The following Vanilla data will be considered during the merge process Attachments Bookmarks Categories Comments Conversations Discussions Roles Users In addition the following plugins have their data merged if present Polls Tagging The Process of Merging Forums 1 Ensure your source forum database is on the same server and accessible by the same database user configured for your destination forum 2 Install and enable the ForumMerge plugin on the destination forum Enabling the plugin may take several seconds to complete if the destination forum is large This is due to the addition of an OldID column across several tables It is also possible the plugin cannot be enabled due to the size of some tables If this step fails you should be presented with SQL commands you will need to run manually against the database before the plugin can be successfully enabled 3 Visit the Merge page listed under Import in the dashboard sidebar 4 Enter your source forums database name and table prefix If you will be merging multiple forums you can specify a Legacy Slug that will identify the records coming from the source separately from any subsequent merges with a different legacy slug 5 Click begin Cross your fingers 6 If the merge is successful the page should appear to refresh but there is currently no status message to confirm 7 If youll be merging in another forum you can visit utilitymergereset to reset all existing OldID fields Notes 1 Do not enable the Forum Merge plugin on the source forum If it has been enabled in the past youll need to remove all OldID and OldCategoryID columns from the relevant tables prior to running the merge Failure to do so will cause a fatal SQL error during the merge because the mergespecific columns OldID OldCategoryID are being selected twice 2 If dumping the destination forum data into an existing forum install with

can return to the addons settings at any time to adjust it in the future Disabling Addons Disabling an addon will remove whatever features it added but it never destroys the data associated with it

Redirector Redirector is a plugin that translates URLs from many popular forum platforms into Vanillafriendly URLs If youre moving from one of the supported platforms installing and enabling this plugin will magically handle maintaining the previous platforms links which can be of tremendous SEO value Supported Platforms 1 IPB 2 Jive 3 phpBB 4 punBB 5 smf 6 vBulletin 7 xenforo Usage 1 Install and enable the plugin 2 Visit a URL from your previous platform against your Vanilla installation For instance if you were coming from vBulletin 4 you might visit httpsitevanillaforumscomshowthreadphpt10001 If all goes well you should be directed to httpsitevanillaforumscomdiscussion10001discussiontitlep1 Legacy Redirects The Redirector plugin supports the ability to target specific forum resources that were imported with the Forum Merge plugin If you used the Forum Merge plugin to import data from a new forum and provided a Legacy Slug during the merge you can reference the original forum resource with its original ID When two forums are merged together with Forum Merge the record IDs from the source forum are updated to resolve conflicts with the destination forums records However if you provided a Legacy Slug the old IDs are combined with this slug and retained This allows you to reference a record from the source forum by its original ID so long as you provide the same legacy slug as a parameter to Redirector As an example say you provided vb as the Legacy Slug during your merge One of the discussions from your source forum had the ID of 1337 However during the merge that ID was reset to 10001 You can still access that discussion with the original ID by using the following URL httpsitevanillaforumscomshowthreadphpt1337legacyvb If all goes well you should be redirected to httpsitevanillaforumscomdiscussion10001discussiontitlep1 Without the legacy parameter set to your source forums Legacy Slug youd be taken to the forums current discussion with an ID of 1337 which would be an entirely different discussion Notes If youre coming from vBulletin or phpBB and experiencing issues you may need to remove showpostphp showthreadphp and viewtopicphp from the root of your Vanilla installation directory"},{"title":"Reporting","href":"/help/addons/reporting/","content":" What is Reporting Reporting is a way for members to bring

forums over a specific time periods Example of dashboard pageimagesdashboardpng How to use Vanilla Statistics The Vanilla Statistics plugin is a display layer for the data that is sent to our analytics server We generate and present you with the statistics in a graphical format for the following Number of page views Number of new users Number of new discussions Number of new comments Using the tabs at the top you can view daily or monthly stats Also by clicking on the coloured boxes below you can isolate the data to one specific data set such as number of new discussions Vanilla Statistics will also create a rolling table of data on the following Most Active Users Most popular discussions discussions This too can be modified by changing the time period you select to view Information from SelfHosted Installs In order to see this visualization on your forums dashboard you must have the Vanilla Statistics plugin bundled with the core product as of Vanilla 2017 Then go to Dashboard Plugins and click Enable next to Vanilla Statistics The only information that is sent to our analytics server is a numeric summary data of the activity in your forum and data that identifies your installation We gather the following data Number of page views Number of new users Number of new discussions Number of new comments Your host name Installed PHP version Installed Vanilla version Webserver type apache iis nginx etc We generate a unique identifier for your forum which along with your hostname allows us to associate the statistics we gather with your specific forum enabling us to display the statistics graph with correct data specific to you Our goal with gathering information about your web server type version php version etc is to allow us to cater to common server configurations and find bugs in house before they happen to you Statistics Configphp In order to display useful analytics graphs on your dashboard Vanilla Statistics needs to be able to link page views discussions and comments to your specific forum installation It does this by registering your site anonymously on our central server receiving a unique hash id in return This hash id is sent alongside every subsequent request your forum makes to us allowing us to link stats to your forum If your config file is not writable we cannot record this hash id so your forum cannot be linked to statistics information nor can your forum properly regulate how often it sends statistics to us If you have received an error message telling you that your config file is not writable statistics will have stopped working for you Simply make your configphp file writable again and stats will resume If you wish to disable statistics all together see the section below entitled Disabling Statistical Reporting Disabling Statistical Reporting It is vitally important to the life of this free opensource software that we accurately measure the reach and effectiveness of Vanilla We ask that you please do not disable the reporting of this data If you must disable this data reporting for some business reason you can do so by adding the following line to your installations configuration file ConfigurationGardenAnalyticsEnabled FALSE Please note that disabling data reporting will cause the Vanilla Statistics plugin to cease to function as we will not have any data to report Using Vanilla Stats on localhost By default statistics wont be sent if you are on a localhost installation If you want to be able to checkout the stats on your localhost for development purposes then add the

your users so you should forward all emails from the address that you want to share Important Make sure your outgoing email address is the same as the one that forwards to your forums email address or else email replies will not work Email Directly into a category You can also set up additional email addresses to forward to individual categories To do this forward email to the appropriate

be publicly viewable to the world The choice is up to you though Allow Users to be Registered through Email When a user emails your forum we check their email address to see what user to post as If there is no user associated with that email address then a new user is created This is fine in cases where you are handling support requests through email but it may not be fine in more tightlyknit communities Use this setting to control whether or not new users can be registered by sending their first email Add Information to the From Field in Email Addresses to Help with Replies If you enable this setting information is added to the from field of email sent from the forum This is done by adding a plus sign and code before the symbol in the email address We recommend this option because some devices such as Blackberry dont send correct header information with their emails Disable this option if your email server doesnt allow the plus signs Outgoing Email Address This is the email

Hub","href":"/help/addons/vanilla-pop/site-hub","content":" Vanilla Pop on the Hub Vanilla Pop works in much the same way on the hub as it does on regular sites The node email addresses are slightly different and there are a few more features which are detailed below Node Email Addresses Each nodes email address is comprised of two parts The node slug and the hub slug seperated by a dot followed by a vanillaforumsemail domain You can see this by going to the Incoming Email page in your nodes dashboards Example Lets say you are on the acme hub and you create a node with the slug anvil You will see that the nodes email address will be shown as anvilacmevanillaforumsemal Emailing Directly Into a Category You can email directly into a category by prepending the categorys URL code to the nodes email address followed by a dot Example Lets say in the above example you want to email the general category You would send an email to generalanvilacmevanillaforumsemail Using One Email Address for an Entire Hub The hub provides a flexible way to email any node and even any category within a node However lets say you want to set up a single email address for your entire hub and have emails route into the nodes Each hub can use an abbreviated email address and then make use of the email subject to route the email to the correct node If you want to do this then the email address for your entire hub is the hub slug followed by the vanillaforumsemail domain Then the first word of the subject will be matched against a node and optional category You can optionally enclose the first word in square brackets Example From the above examples you have the acme hub and the anvil node and the general category The hubs email address is acmevanillaforumsemail An email with the subject anvil I need some help will be routed to the anvil node An email with the subject generalanvil I need some help will be routed to the general category of the anvil node Removing the Node Slug to Email Categories You can have your hub configured to remove the need for node slugs in the subject of emails To do so you must do the following 1 Ensure that you use unique URL codes across all of your nodes This is your responsibility 2 Make a support request to configure your hub to look at the category of a node first Setting Up a Custom Email Address for Your Hub The reason why the hub supports a single email address is to allow you to set up a single custom email address for your communities and then use the subject to route emails accordingly In order to do so you must have control over the email address and then you must do the following 1 Set up your email address to forward all emails to the hubs email address 2 Make a support request notifying Vanilla staff of your forward Tell them what the email address is and they will configure your hub to send emails from that address In order to make the email forwarding work you must ensure the following 1 The emails must not be altered when being forwarded ex dont add a Fw prefix to the subjects 2 In order to ensure the best email routing the email should readdd any arguments in the email address to the forums email address This is common behaviour amongst most email servers Email Replies and Hub Email Addresses Most emails sent to your communities will be in reply to a notification such as a comment or a private message In this case Vanilla adds special routing information to help make sure the reply is routed to the correct community In this case this information will take precidence over the specific email address In most cases users will not know this but if you specifically try and alter an email address when replying to try and make the email send to a specific community you might still find that the email still goes to its originally indended destination Emailing to a NonExistant Node If your email address or subject is malformed in such a way that Vanilla cannot find the node you are trying to email then it will send back a response telling you that the site you are trying to email could not be found"},{"title":"Adding and Editing User

moderators to keep track of information about users that may be important to other moderators Warning Levels and Expiry When a moderator warns a user the severity of the warning determines how many points it adds to the users warning level and when the warning expires Admins can see a users warning level from the member profile via a banner at the top Moderators can see the details of warning and expiry from the notes tab When a users warnings expire then their warning level will be reset to zero and the user will have a clean slate If you warn a user that has already been warned then the points from the new warning will be added their warning level and their expiry will be extended When a user reaches certain warning levels they will be punished Warning Level 3 Jailed Users that reach warning level 3 are considered jailed Being jailed means the following A jail icon is overlaid over the users avatar The user cant start new discussions The user is flood controlled so they can only post once every 150 seconds The users signature is hidden The idea behind being jailed is to punish the user a little bit to let them know that youre serious but to let them continue to be a part of

enterprisegrade deployments Configurations Single Community This is a classic forum setup It is the equivalent of 1 installation of forum software It can have any number of categories what other products call topic areas or forumssubforums arranged in a hierarchy Each Single Community needs a domain or subdomain assigned The Hub A Hub is a community mothership Setup one community as a template then create Nodes that are copies of this setup Each Node is a Single Community with the added ability of being synchedcloudmultisitesync with changes made on the Hub Each Node is otherwise independent from each other separate user lists private message exchanges and activity streams Each Node is accessible via either a subdomain or a subfolder off a domain shared by the whole Hub This is called the Hub URL Format For example the muffins Node in the bakery Hub might be accessible at the URLs muffinsbakerycompanycom or bakerycompanycommuffins depending on the configuration Only one type of Hub URL Format is supported per Hub Subcommunities This artificially divides a Single Community or a Node into different areas by making each of the top tier of categories into subcommunities While in any particular subcommunity all other content outside the subcommunity is completely hidden A common use case for subcommunities is localization All subcommunities are still part of a single instance the user list and therefore moderators admins private messages and activity stream are shared across all subcommunities Each subcommunity has its own URL path prefix For instance visiting the Recent Discussions page of the English subcommunity for forumcompanycom would take the user to forumcompanycomendiscussions The user would see only discussions that are in the subcategories under the English top tier category A common way of combining this feature with the Hub is to create a Node per product and use subcommunities for each locale within that product Architectural considerations Cluster management Our physical server assets are arranged into clusters Each cluster can hold many Single Communities or a single Hub its Nodes They cannot be mixed Scaling capabilities Because each Node is a separate entity there are significant scaling advantages to choosing a hub setup over a single community subcommunities setup Suggested setups For smalltomedium sites use a single community Add subcommunities for multilocale support or to combine several microforums into a single instance For very large or franchise sites use a dedicated Hub with a Node per locale This provides maximum scaling potential Embedding iframes While we do support robust embedding iframe solutions we strongly recommend avoiding it whenever possible It drastically increases project complexity and negatively impacts user experience with longer page load time SSL certificates We will need SSL certificates that cover all potential custom domain names For Hub setups this generally means a wildcard

Vanilla offers SSL support in Corporate plans and above In order for us to to enable SSL for your forum you will need to provide Vanilla with the following Certificates start like this BEGIN CERTIFICATE Private keys start like this BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY 1 The SSL Certificate for your forums domain in PEM format 2 The SSL Certificate Private Key for your forums domain in PEM format and with no password 3 The optional Intermediate SSL Certificate for your certificate issuing authority How to obtain your SSL certificates Usually youll get an SSL certificate in one of two ways 1 Ask an IT professional at your company They should know exactly what an SSL certificate is and can coordinate sending a certificate to Vanillas cloud support Showing them this documentation will also help 2 Obtain a new SSL certificate through a Certificate Authority Companies like Verisign and TRUSTe act as Certificate Authorities CA and you can purchase an SSL certificate through them Explaining the entire process of purchasing your own SSL certificate is going to be different for each vendor and is beyond the scope of this documentation We recommend contacting the support channel of a CA to get more information on purchasing a new SSL certificate What is this Intermediate SSL Certificate SSL has 2 components trust and encryption Encryption is fairly straightforward the certificate is used to encrypt communication between the client and the server Trust on the other hand is more complex Web browsers are preconfigured to know about a certain set of CAs but if your certificate was issued by a CA that is not in that list your browser does not know whether it can be trusted The intermediate certificate solves that problem by connecting the broken chain between your certificate and a CA that the browser trusts Intermediate certificates are an important part of ensuring that customers see a green Secure symbol in their address bar when they access your site Why cant Vanilla create an SSL certificate for your site The SSL process would be much smoother if Vanilla could just set it up without requiring anything from you This just isnt possible though due to the underlying security of SSL and the Internet The owner of a domain name is the only person that can generate an SSL certificate And if you think about it this is a good thing If we could generate an SSL certificate for you then so could a hacker How to give SSL certificates to Vanilla Once you have your SSL certificates youll need to give them to Vanilla support Dont just email your SSL certificates to us These certificates are sort of like passwords and special care should be taken to provide them to us in a secure way Here are some options 1 Secure FTP sftp If youve been given an SFTP account on Vanillas project server then you should upload your certificates there 2 PGP Encrypted Email If you have the ability to send PGP encrypted email then you can send your SSL certificates that way Please send them to opsvanillaforumscom Our public key is included in this documentation BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK mQINBFY3hRUBEADXVOVM6ZjiQCJxsYPeS9ob01mBwXuBRZEOgf8x9AmNzZHEwr

Vanilla community Comments made on content on their website will create discussions in their community Also any comment made on the forum discussion will be reflected back under the content What are Universal Comments We made Comment integration easy with WordPress learn more about that herefeatureswordpressusingcomments but we also wanted to make it possible to add comments to any site where you can identify unique content Universal Comments a way to do that How to use Universal Comments To know if you can use Vanilla Universal Comments you need to know if your content has a unique id What does that mean In your URL or code is there a way to identify the difference between two pages For example in Magento you have a productid in Concrete5 there is the PageId in MODX its the Resource ID and so on This identifier is how you can assign a comment box from Vanilla to a specific document on any platform Essentially if you have a way to identify unique content you can use Vanilla Comments Once youve determined you have the necessary identifier to get started with Vanilla Comments head to your Vanilla Forums dashboard and look for Blog Comments under the Forum heading You will see the following Universal CommentsfeaturescommentsimagesBlogCommentssettingspng You want to make sure you have enabled embedding The next step is to select the Universal Code setting tab Universal Comments tabfeaturescommentsimagesBlogCommentsuniversalcodepng On this tab you will find code to paste into your platform you are using wherever you want your comment box to appear Usually this will be after the content your platform calls Universal Comments tabfeaturescommentsimagesBlogCommentsUniversalCodeIdentifierpng Please note before you paste the code in your platforms template or theme you will need to modify the elements highlighted in yellow The first element you need to review is that the correct full urlpath to your Vanilla install is in the code The second element you will need to add and that is the code that calls the unique id for the current page Replace yourcontentidentifier with the appropriate code so Vanilla can connect the discussion created to the proper content Finally within the comments code you can You can modify Universal Comments code to allow all comments to appear in one discussion thread You can make the comments to appear in a certain category of your community This can be helpful if you integrate Vanilla Comments into a ecommerce shop where you want all product reviews to be placed in the Product Review category There are some additional settings

Embedding","href":"/help/features/embedding/advanced","content":" Advanced Embedding The advanced embedding technique is for developers who require programmatic interaction between the Vanilla iframe

using thisiframe Methods start Start the embed Only call this method if you set autoStart to false setLocationpath Manually set the location of the embedded iframe Just specify the path and not the full domain of the embed Custom Callbacks The embed API allows custom Javascript to be called between the parent and child iframes Exposing a method to Vanilla You can expose a method to the child iframe with the following code javascript VanillaembedfnfunctionName functionargs The embed requires all functions on both sides to be explicitly registered to prevent a third party hijacking the embed and calling functions with unforeseen consequences Vanilla embed supports a callback function on both ends of the embed If you want to support a callback function then declare it as the last argument of your function When the other endpoint of the embed calls your function using callRemote it can then specify a callback and the framework will handle calling the callback across the domain Calling a method in Vanilla You can call a method in Vanilla with the following code javascript VanillaembedcallRemotefunctionName args callback If you supply the callback argument to callRemote then it will be supplied as the last argument to the remote function It is the remote functions job to call the function Keep in mind that using call apply etc to set a context for the function will not work as a context cannot be passed across the domain Functions you can call on Vanilla Vanillaembedsignout Calling this function will sign the user out of Vanilla It wont refresh the page so you may

implement comments There is a WordPress pluginhttpswordpressorgpluginsvanillaforums available that allows you to enable comments on your WordPress blog from your WordPress dashboard Alternately we

forum category based on the blog post category What does Vanilla use as an excerpt from my blog article when creating a blog comment discussion When Vanilla creates a discussion thread based on a blog article it will grab the blog title the first few lines of the blog text and an image You can use Open Graph meta tags to specify what image should be used Otherwise it grabs the first 4 images on the

Vanilla Forum without needing a separate username and password In broad terms an SSO solution defines how two systems securely communicate the identity of a user that is switching between them In the context of Vanilla that means the forum securely talking to your site or identity provider to see if a user is signed in and then automatically using that identity Solutions We Offer Vanilla offers three flavors of single signon jsConnectfeaturesssojsconnect our inhouse solution SAMLfeaturesssosaml and OAuthfeaturesssooauth SAML and OAuth are currently only available on cloud and the latter requires services work to integrate specifically with your platform We also offer custom SSO integrations at our highest plan tiers Why jsConnect SSO systems are complex Setting up your own SAML or OAuth system takes a lot of time and generally is not feasible for smalltomedium business owners If you have a website that stores your users identity and the only thing you need to integrate is a forum jsConnect is a far simpler solution This is because weve abstracted most of the work to our side of the connection and provide sample code for making your side However even our easier solution does require a developer on your team A developer can typically set up the client side of jsConnect in 26 hours using our technical documentationfeaturesssojsconnectoverview The only exception is WordPress users for which weve developed a readytogo SSO pluginhttpswordpressorgpluginsvanillaforums Ready to learn more about jsConnect Our concepts overviewfeaturesssojsconnect is where to head next"},{"title":"Embedded","href":"/help/features/sso/jsconnect/embed","content":" Embedding with Seamless jsConnect Part 1 of this documentation told you how to set up jsConnect SSO for sitewide SSO However if you have Vanilla embedded in a page youll notice that the SSO doesnt automatically sign you in even if users are signed in to the containing page In order to make the sign in seamless you need to add some SSO information to your embed code First well address another important issue Mobile Safari Attempting embedded SSO across two domains will not work in this browser and therefore on all Apple devices To solve this your forum must be hosted on a subdomain of your main site For example if your site is urlcom you could put your forum on forumurlcom and then embed it from there This sidesteps Mobile Safaris issue and potentially increases your search engine value as well Our clients can change their forum to a subdomain of their site by going to Customize Domain in their Dashboard and following the instructions there Now on to revising your embed code with some additional SSO information Vanilla Embed Code Consider the embed code for Vanilla comments ltscript

you cant use SSO on a static page Gotchas The above example is for blog comments For a full forum embed use the code provided under Forum Embed in the Dashboard Even though your signature string is base64 encoded make sure the actual signature is hex encoded The correct string will be 40 characters consisting of the numbers 09 and af The timestamp is a unix timestamp That means it will be an integer and represents the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 Most languages have a way of getting this timestamp nbsp"},{"title":"SSO with jsConnect","href":"/help/features/sso/jsconnect/","content":" jsConnect Concepts Overview Our SSO solution has a few basic assumptions Your user is signed into a website You control this website and can add files pages to it The integration will be a lot easier and tighter if You have unique validated usernames for users You have confirmed unique email addresses for users Creating mapping users Data that can currently be passed over SSO with jsConnect Unique ID from your system required Email required Username recommended Photo URL Roles Vanillas permissions management groups When receiving an SSO response Vanilla will do a lookup by email address against the forum database If it finds a match and the user connects a permanent mapping is made against the unique ID your provided This means future email changes on your side do not effect the login process If no email match is found a new forum account will be created instantly using the provided data If no username is provided the user will be prompted to create one Data is synced at every new login For instance providing a different email address on the users fifth login will still log them into the same account but will update their Vanilla email address The Photo URL is accepted only if the user has not uploaded their own avatar in the forum yet and it is a valid URL Imported avatars if you migrated to Vanilla from another platform count as the user having uploaded their own avatar We strongly recommend against creating new users via the API Our SSO solution lazycreates new users for maximum robustness and reliability Once a new user is created you can optionally sync additional data about the user over API as needed Unified user experience In Vanilla these optional configuration changes are possible Autoconnect to existing forum user accounts without prompting for a password ie your SSO source is 100 trusted Disable all email sending in Vanilla Disable profile editing Redirect user profile links to another system Cloud users can contact support to make these changes How it connects Clicking the Sign In button in Vanilla generates an asynchronous request in the users browser session back to the main website This means the users cookies are sent as if they had visited the page directly and that your normal login detection logic will work featuresssoimagesjsconnectoverviewpng Two Flavors of SSO There are two implementations of SSO that jsConnect supports You can implement either of the methods or both as they serve different purposes Method 1 SiteWide SSO You implement sitewide SSO when Vanilla is as a full site With this method you need to create a page that provides your login information in jsonp format Method 2 Embedded SSO Vanilla also has the ability to be embedded in an html page either as an entire site or just as embedded comments With this scenario you need to create a special SSO string that can be passed to the embedded Vanilla and provide login information Make it seamless When setting up a jsConnect connection in fullsite mode you have the option to specify it as default Doing this attaches it to the special sso endpoint in Vanilla When a user clicks Forum in your websites navigation instead of linking to the forum homepage instead link them to the sso page This will autofire the asynchronous call back to your website rather than waiting for the user to click sign in then drops them on the homepage as normal For more information read our technical overviewfeaturesssojsconnectoverview WordPress plugin If your site is using WordPress then we make a plugin that allows you to use SSO with your WordPress site It also helps you set up an embedded forum and embedded comments on your site Get the plugin"},{"title":"Technical Overview","href":"/help/features/sso/jsconnect/overview","content":" jsConnect Technical Overview For jsConnect to work youll put some code on your site that identifies your users in a way that Vanilla can understand Vanilla then requests this information when the user wants to sign in and synchronizes the user with Vanilla This is done via JSONPhttpenwikipediaorgwikiJSONP which allows us to send your cookies from your site to you and obtain login information Vanillas webbased single sign on SSO has 2 parts 1 Your SSO endpoint based on one of our example libraries on your site 2 Vanillas jsConnect plugin jsConnect pings your endpoint whenever it wants to know if a user is logged in on your site It does this using the users current session so you can use your normal is logged in detection to determine this nothing fancy here Your endpoint Your endpoint needs to say 1 of 3 things when its called 1 The current user is a guest not logged in 2 User is logged in here but this wasnt a secure request no signature timestamp so heres their name photo only 3 User is logged in AND this was securely requested so heres all the user data including email and a unique ID from your system which are required Our example libraries help you structure the output so that jsConnect can read it correctly If we provide a client library that you can use then we highly recommend using it These libraries are open source and maintained on Github PHP jsConnect client libraryhttpsgithubcomvanillaforumsjsConnectPHP Ruby jsConnect client libraryhttpsgithubcomvanillaforumsjsConnectRuby Java jsConnect client libraryhttpsgithubcomvanillaforumsjsConnectJava NET jsConnect client libraryhttpsgithubcomvanillaforumsjsConnectdotNet All of these libraries have one file with all of the library code youll need and one file that gives an example usage They also have a readme that tells you which file is which Please note that these libraries dont support embedded SSOfeaturesssojsconnectembed If your site is programmed in a language that doesnt have a client library then we provide documentation on our jsConnect protocol Have a look at the jsConnect technical implementationfeaturesssojsconnectseamless How jsConnect maps users After calling your endpoint and getting a signed in reply jsConnect looks up the user If theyve already used SSO weve permanently mapped their unique ID to our UserID so we sign them into that account If they havent used SSO before 1 of 3 things happens 1 If the email for the user has never been used on the forum it makes them a new account using the data passed and signs them into it 2 If the email is in use and AutoConnect is enabled we will immediately sign them in and permanently store the mapping 3 If the email is in use and AutoConnect is NOT enabled we will prompt the user for their forum password to confirm their identity This is the default setting because it is safer to assume you havent verified their email address Vanilla Cloud customers should request Support enable AutoConnect if they desire it That is an important component of a seamless experience Tightening the integration To get very tight SSO integration you will also want to follow these steps Always carefully test your basic SSO authentication before tightening your integration 1 Change your registration method to Connect to block nonSSO users from registering 2 Set your signin signout and registration URLs under jsConnects settings in your Dashboard 3 Check Make this connection your default signin method 4 When linking or redirecting signedin users to your forum use the sso endpoint on the forum This triggers jsConnects user lookup on the connection with default sign in method selected without the user needing to click Optionally you can provide a Target parameter with a relative path to specify where they should ultimately land on the forum Example httpforumyoursitecomssoTargetcategories This is the final critical step in a fully seamless experience 5 For seamless SSO on an embedded forum see our embedded SSO solutionhttpblogvanillaforumscomjsconnecttechnicaldocumentationforembeddedsso Testing the integration Use the Test URL link under your jsConnect settings to see if your endpoint is returning a good response Try using your browsers IncognitePrivate window mode for testing This allows you to have a separate test session while you stay logged in as the administrator in your main session to make changes quickly Common questions What do we do if SSO breaks and were locked out You can log back in using the hidden URL entrypassword to signin with an existing forum account This page is never redirected for SSO Cant we just add users over the API We strongly recommend against adding users over the API Using jsConnect and allowing it to add users as they signin is the most robust and reliable approach that will cause you the fewest issues Can we use multiple SSO connections Absolutely However only one can be the default which is what will trigger when sso is used How do we have seamless signin for users who go directly to the forum If youve followed all the steps above the only way a user can be not signed into the forum while signed into your main site is if they sign into your site separately and then manually visit the forum by typing in the address manually or clicking a browser bookmark In this scenario they would need to click a prompt to finish forum signin How is signout handled We bounce them to your signin page after they signout on the forum To do the opposite redirect users thru our signout page again passing a Target parameter so they finish where you want them to Does this work for native applications nonweb scenarios or thirdparty products No jsConnect is purely a webbased SSO workflow for your existing login system We have separate products for popular thirdparty platforms and nonweb scenarios Can we reverseSSO to Vanilla via API to see if a user is logged in there Not at this time Can we use jsConnect without providing an email address No You absolutely must send an email which is the only method for mapping users If you are importing forum users without email addresses and need a way to map them over SSO we recommend using dummy email addresses that follow a formula like uniqueIDyoursitecom Our system has overlapping names but Vanilla needs unique ones How can we handle this We strongly recommend assigning them unique usernames in your system then passing that unique username to jsConnect Keep in mind that for features like mentions and autocomplete to work usernames must be unique and adhere to Vanillas username restrictions Passing a duplicate Name field for a new user over jsConnect will cause the connection to fail Can we set roles over jsConnect Yes see our technical documentationfeaturesssojsconnectseamless for more information The settings endpoint response look correct now but its still not working or redirecting properly Try clearing your cookies and browser cache and restarting your browser Use IncognitoPrivate mode whenever possible Also beware of Firefox caching redirects when in doubt doublecheck a redirect using another browser Repeatedly attempting SSO with many sessions and accounts with changing settings can cause unexpected results This isnt a problem users would ever run into daytoday"},{"title":"Seamless Setup","href":"/help/features/sso/jsconnect/seamless","content":" Seamless SSO with jsConnect jsConnect uses javascript to allow crossdomain singlesignon with another site We provide several client libraries to help you implement jsConnect on your site If your site has been programmed in a language that doesnt have a client library than this is documentation is for you Please note that this is technical documentation and requires knowledge programming to understand Functions Youll Need jsConnect makes use of some functions that are available in most modern programming languages You might want to do a bit of research to see if your language supports these functions because they are quite difficult to implement yourself Ive tried to make the functions a generic as possible but theyll most likely be called something different in our language A little googling should help you find what you need timestamp Return the current unix timestamp Note that your server has to have its time reasonably in synch with Vanillas server json encode Encode an objectassociative array in the json ex name Joe email joenoreplycom query string encode Encode an objectassociative array like a query string in RFC1738 ex nameJoeampemailjoe40noreplycom md5 or sha1 Call an md5 or sha1 hash on a string We strongly recommend sha1 We also have an SSO module for automatically signing in to an embedded forum If you are for sure going to just embed Vanilla then you might want to try this first base 64 encode Encode a string in base64 notation hmac sha1 Call the hmacsha1 hashing algorithm on a string and a secret key Concepts JSONP JSONP is a technology that browsers can use to get around the sameorigin limitation of bowsers and make crossdomain requests Vanilla uses jsonp to transmit some of its SSO information When you program a jsonp page it must follow a specific format To best illustrate this lets use an example Lets say I want to request a jsonp response from the getnamejson page What Id do is make a request to that page with a querystring parameter called callback like this getnamejsoncallbackdisplayname Now if Im programming getnamejson its my job to display my response in jsonp format which would look something like this displaynamename Todd Youll notice a couple of things here I passed a callback parameter to the page The value of the parameter is used as the name of a function Im calling in the response The function is passed an argument encoded in json Whatever I want to pass to the other site must be json encoded like this Important When writing a page that returns jsonp you must ALWAYS return valid javascript If you return HTML or something else then the page wont work This is something that a lot of people get wrong Client ID and Secret In order to secure your singlesignon connection you must share a client ID and secret between your site and Vanilla Your client ID is used to identify your site and is public Your secret is like a sitepassword and must be kept secret Do not share your secret with anyone When setting up jsConnect in Vanillas dashboard there is a button to generate a client ID and secret You can use this button or create your own You can use a more freindly name for your client ID but stick to numbers and letter We recommend using a secret that is generated by Vanilla Signing a Request If youve done any single signon or authentication work youve probably run into the concept of signing a request Basically you sign a request with your shared secret so that both sites know that the request came from a legitimate source When you transmit user information you want to also sign that information so that I know it came from your site and not someone else trying to hack into Vanilla jsConnect uses signatures to secure its requests To sign a request you use a hash function such as md5 or sha1 You can select a variety of hash functions but we recommend using sha1 because it is more secure and widely available We recommend getting jsConnect working without signatures first and then securing them In Vanilla you can put your jsConnect connection in test mode and it wont check for a signature Just make sure you dont go live without signing your requests SiteWide SSO For sitewide SSO youll need to make a page on your site that provides authentication information We call this your authentication page You can call it whatever you want but for the purposes of this documentation well call it authenticatejson Request GET authenticatejsonparameters Parameters clientid REQUIRED Your shared client ID that youve configured in Vanillas dashboard callback REQUIRED The name of the callback function timestamp OPTIONAL For secure requests Vanilla will send you the timestamp of its request If you are checking security then you want make sure that the timestamp isnt too old We recommend a timeframe of 530 minutes signature OPTIONAL For secure requests Vanilla will sign the timestamp parameter Response There are four valid responses you can return depending on the request and whether or not the user is signed in No User Response The user is not signed in to your site callbackname photourl Notes Even if there is no user signed in you still must return a valid jsonp response So in this case we just return an empty user User Stub Response The user is signed in to your site but the request hasnt been signed callback name John Doe photourl httpnositecomjohndoepng Notes Vanilla sends an unsigned request to your page just to provide a picture and photo to the user as a notice that they are signed on to your site User Response The user is signed in to your site and the request is signed or you are testing callback uniqueid 1234 REQUIRED The ID that uniquely identifies the user on your site name John Doe REQUIRED The name of the user on your site email johndoenoreplycom REQUIRED The users email address photourl httpnositecomjohndoepng OPTIONAL A photo for the user roles memberadministrator OPTIONAL You can configure jsConnect to synchronize roles clientid 123456789 REQUIRED Your client ID signature cdb398fdab244999d8ba301eb6334298 REQUIRED The signature of this response Notes This response is the heart of jsConnect It tells Vanilla about the user signed in to your system so that Vanilla can sign the user into Vanilla too There are a few important points about this response uniqueid name clientid and signature are required Make sure you provide us with these values in your response and make sure they have values The uniqueid field must never change for a given user Your site usually has some sort of integer or guid that uniquely identifies a user Use this The signature is used to secure the response and is very important but can be left out if you are just testing How to sign the response is explained below Error Response Some error has occurred error response callback error invalidclient REQUIRED A string identifier for the error message Client ID does not match REQUIRED A userreadable error message Notes You usually return an error response if a request has invalid security information However you can also return an error response if your application encounters an unknown error on its own Other Notes on your Response Make sure you return an HTTP 200 response ie no error codes You can set the ContentType to applicationjavascript if you wish but its not necessary Securing SiteWide SSO You can get your jsConnect page working without worrying about security but in order for your SSO to be secure you have to a check the request to make sure it is secure and b sign your response so that Vanilla can make sure its secure Checking the Request for Security In order to make sure the request from Vanilla is legitimate you must first check the request You do this on your authentication page before displaying your response If the request doesnt check out you need to display an error response with some information on what might have gone wrong Here are the things you should check Make sure the request provides a clientid error invalidrequest message The clientid parameter is missing Make sure clientid matches the client ID youve set up on your site error invalidclient message Unknown client See if a timestamp was provided If no timestamp was provided return the no user response or the user stub response If a timestamp was provided you need to make sure it checks out Make sure the timestamp isnt at most 530 minutes in the past or future error invalidrequest message The timestamp is invalid Make sure the request has a signature error invalidrequest message Missing signature parameter Make sure the signature is valid To check the signature you must do the following if hashconcattimestamp secret signature valid else invalid Basically you concatenate your secret to the end of the timestamp and call your hash function If your calculated signature matches the signature passed to the request then the request is valid error accessdenied message Signature invalid If youve checked all of the above conditions and havent encountered any errors then the request is valid and you can display the appropriate response First you need to sign it though Signing your Response for Security Once youve checked the request for security you need to sign your response so that Vanilla can check security on its end To show you how to do this consider the following users sso information and the following client ID and secret user uniqueid 1234 name John Doe email johndoenoreplycom photourl httpnositecomjohndoepng clientid 123456789 secret 985d2f9eb57a8b55db3c04c20272bce9308764b0 dont give this out Here is how you sign the user with the secret Sort the user by keys usersorted emailjohndoenoreplycom nameJohn Doe photourlhttpnositecomjohndoepng uniqueid1234 Url encode the sorted user with RFC1738 a fancy way of saying make it a query string This gives you your signature string signaturestring emailjohndoe40noreplycomampnameJohnDoeampphotourlhttp3A2F2Fnositecom2Fjohndoepngampuniqueid1234 Concatenate the signature with your secret and call your hash function around everything signature sha1concatsignaturestring secret Now you want to add both your clientid and your signature back into the user user uniqueid 1234 name John Doe email

Troubleshooting Make sure you dont add your clientid or signature to your sso user until the last step If your usernames are going to use nonascii characters such as accents then make sure your page is encoded using utf8 and that you have an appropriate ContentType header Try and make sure your system doesnt have any spaces at the beginning or end of usernames or email addresses You wont be able to see the spaces but they usually arent allowed in usernames and will mean the user isnt allowed to register with Vanilla Whats Next At this point you should have a valid jsConnect authentication page and Vanilla will be able to recognize your users You just need to set up the connection in Vanilla and youre good to go If you want to implement embedded SSO then head over to part 2 of this

### Enabling Advanced Search

Advanced search will enhance search functionality:

 * Better indexing of content 
 * The ability to apply filters to searches 
 * Auto-complete of results as the user types the search terms 


To enable Advanced Search, you will need to enable the addon and then make a change to your base theme:

 * On the addons page of the Dashboard, enable Advanced Search
 * Under the Appearance section of the Dashboard, go to the Customer Theme page 
 * In the HTML tab, look for the following code  {searchbox}
 * Change that code to  {searchbox_advanced}


Notes:

 * Advanced search is not available on all plan levels.

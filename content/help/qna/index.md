## Overview

Vanilla supports question and answer type discussions. Q&A discussions differ in the following ways:

 * When a question is answered, the member who asked the question will receive a notification and will be prompted to indicate if the answer answered the question or not.  
 * Valid answers are highlighted and displayed at the top of the discussion list. 
 * Members who answer questions will receive badges (if badges are turned on). 
 * A shortcut can be displayed in the side menu to show all unanswered questions. 


## Turning on Q&A  

The Q&A addon must be turned on to enable Q&A. It can be found in the Dashboard under Addons > Addons


## Addon Settings

There is only one setting for the Q&A plugin:  you can decided if reputation points should be awarded to members for answering questions.

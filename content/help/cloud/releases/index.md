## Release Notes

Our clients on [VIP plans](https://vanillaforums.com/plans) receive a timed code release every two months with new features, fixes, and enhancements. All other plan levels receive these changes continuously as they become available.

We publish changes after each VIP release below, well after other plan levels may have received it.

## Enabling File Upload

File Upload helps you insert photos into posts, or attach small documents and other files. This functionality is built into Advanced Editor, which is enabled in your community by default. If you are looking to embed videos, tweets, or other content into your post, we’ve documented that process [here](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/help/posting/smart-embed/).

## How to Upload a File

When composing a post, click the file icon to open the File Upload menu:

 ![This shows the File Upload menu. You can also simply drag images into the text area without expanding the menu](https://images.v-cdn.net/docs/upload_file_upload_menu.jpg)

You can then either drag and drop a file into the menu, or you can click “Choose Files”  to open your file browser. After you select a file, it will be added to your text area. How this looks will depend on what “Post Format” you have selected in the Advanced Editor’s settings.

WYSIWYG will display the image inside the post as you edit:

HTML, BBC, and Markdown will display as code:
 ![This is the editor with HTML formatting selected. ](https://images.v-cdn.net/docs/upload_code.jpg)

If you want to attach an image, but don’t want to display it inline with your text, you can remove it from the text field. This will create post with a small thumbnail of your image that users can click, rather than inserting the full image. File types that cannot be embedded inline will also display this way, allowing users to click the icon to download.

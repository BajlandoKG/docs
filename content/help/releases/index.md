## Release Notes for Cloud

Our customers on [VIP plans](https://vanillaforums.com/plans) receive a product update once per quarter with new features, fixes, and enhancements. We coordinate these releases with our customers and provide custom QA or custom scheduling as required.

Customers with a success manager receive updates approximately every other week at a fixed time which is not pre-announced. Other plan levels and all staging sites may receive these updates on an ad-hoc basis.

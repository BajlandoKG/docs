## Release Notes

Quarterly VIP releases contain all numbered releases within said quarter.

### Q1 release 4 (Wednesday, Mar 1)

* Categories: Add category filtering to settings page.
* Categories: Remove "Track points separately" from category options unless Reactions has been configured to support it.
* Reactions: Adds settings page to configure per-category point tracking.
* Reporting: Use permission Reactions.Flag.Add to allow restriction of reporting to certain users. If you are not already using Reactions, it will default to all users, which was how it previously worked.
* Dashboard: Hide version number because it is not relevant (and misleading) to cloud customers.
* Pockets: Add easier enable/disable toggles.
* Addons: Improve error reporting for easier troubleshooting.
* Categories: Fix issue where child categories could be redundantly displayed in certain theme views. (#5195)
* Comments module: Add discussion titles. (This module is not used on most forums).
* Pockets/Customize Theme: Fix errors in code editor.
* Framework: Remove OAuth 1.0 library from core.
* Minor security fixes. (Minor means they were technically flaws, but to our knowledge no useful exploit could be derived from them.)
* API: architectural updates to facilitate upcoming v2.

### Q1 release 3 (Thursday, Feb 16)

* Groups: Delete group's discussions and comments when a group is deleted.

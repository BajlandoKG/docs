The Vanilla API v2 is the latest version of Vanilla's RESTful API. We've taken all the lessons learned from our first API and made a more consistent, useful API for integrating within your applications.

## Improvements in API v2

- More authentication options including per-user access tokens.
- A live API reference in your dashboard where you can reference API methods and make calls right from within the documentation.
- More endpoints so you can control more of your site from the API.
- Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) support.

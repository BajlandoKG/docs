      <description>Warnings &amp;amp; Notes is version 2 The first version of this addon was titled simply &amp;ldquo;Warnings&amp;rdquo;. It did not include the User Notes feature. It had more granular controls for Warning a user with particular point levels and durations.
We recommend all users disable the &amp;ldquo;Warnings&amp;rdquo; addon if they still have it and immediately enable the &amp;ldquo;Warnings &amp;amp; Notes&amp;rdquo; addon instead.
Why does &amp;ldquo;Warnings &amp;amp; Notes&amp;rdquo; have less granular settings?</description>

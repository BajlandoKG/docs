      <description>Overview &amp;ldquo;Posting&amp;rdquo; or commenting on a discussion is the primary way users will interact with your community. There is a range of discussion types, helping communities adjust the functionality to suit their needs.

Users are able to type their comments here and submit them by hitting the “Post Comment” button. That comment will immediately append the bottom of the discussion, adding it to the conversation.</description>

      <description>Vanilla Comments Vanilla comments allow any website with a unique content id to add a commenting system that can seamlessly integrate with their Vanilla community. Comments made on content on their website will create discussions in their community. Also any comment made on the forum discussion will be reflected back under the content.

      <description>Enabling File Attachments This functionality is built into Advanced Editor, which is enabled in your community by default. If you are looking to embed videos, tweets, or other content into your post, we’ve documented that process here.
Inserting Images and Uploading Files This icon indicates the Attach File tool. With Advanced Editor, there are a few ways to attach files to a post.
The easiest way to upload is the drag-and-drop method.</description>

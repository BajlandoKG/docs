In order to make the sign in seamless you need to add some SSO information to your embed code.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ll address another important issue: Mobile Safari.</description>

      <description>jsConnect For jsConnect to work you&amp;rsquo;ll put some code on your site that identifies your users in a way that Vanilla can understand. Vanilla then requests this information when the user wants to sign in and synchronizes the user with Vanilla. This is done via JSONP, which allows us to send your cookies from your site to you and obtain login information.

This is because we&amp;rsquo;ve abstracted most of the work to our side of the connection, and provide sample code for making your side.</description>

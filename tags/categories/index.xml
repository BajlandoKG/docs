      <description>What Are Categories Categories are how Vanilla organizes discussions within a community. Categories can be added, edited, deleted, sorted, and tiered via the Dashboard. Every discussion is placed in one (and only one) category. You can find Categories under the Settings tab Dashboard, listed under “Forum Settings”. You can access it directly by going to /vanilla/settings/categories.
At the top of the page, you will presented with the option to either add a new category, or disable them completely.</description>

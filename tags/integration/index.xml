      <description>This feature is only available on Vanilla Cloud Learn More...  Developer Support VIP plans include developer support, offered for a fixed period of time for a fixed number of individuals in your organization. During that time, those folks can reach out directly to Vanilla developers for advanced assistance in setting up embedding, single sign-on, theming, and appropriate addons &amp;amp; settings.
We will continue to assist you with our outstanding professional support even after your developer support ends.</description>

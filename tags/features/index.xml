      <description>Advanced settings Advanced Editor has different modes to help you accommodate the needs of your community.
By default, all forums are set to use Markdown as their post format.
Wysiwyg WYSIWYG stands for &amp;ldquo;What you see is what you get&amp;rdquo;. It is a familiar and intuitive format for most end users. In this mode, pictures and text formatting will display in the editor as the user composes their post, eliminating the need for them to understand formatting tags.</description>

Each one can add one or more features, or modify how an existing feature works. You can tailor your users&amp;rsquo; experience to the needs of your community by carefully selecting addons.
Vanilla is structured such that its baseline installation only contains features that we feel are essential to every community. Addons let you flavor Vanilla to the specific needs of the community you are building.</description>

      <description>Embedding with Seamless jsConnect Part 1 of this documentation told you how to set up jsConnect SSO for site-wide SSO. However, if you have Vanilla embedded in a page you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the SSO doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically sign you in even if users are signed in to the containing page.

      <description>What are Warnings? Warnings can be given to users by moderators for behavior that is not appropriate in the community. Warnings use a points system that increases a user’s warning level with successive warnings until the warnings expire. Once users reach certain points thresholds they can be jailed or banned.
What are Notes? User notes are notes attached to individual users that only moderators can add and see. They allow moderators to keep track of information about users that may be important to other moderators.</description>

      <description>Why jsConnect? SSO systems are complex. Setting up your own SAML or OAuth system takes a lot of time, and generally is not feasible for small-to-medium business owners.
If you have a website that stores your user&amp;rsquo;s identity and the only thing you need to integrate is a forum, jsConnect is a far simpler solution. This is because we&amp;rsquo;ve abstracted most of the work to our side of the connection, and provide sample code for making your side.</description>

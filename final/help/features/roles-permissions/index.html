<h1 id="roles-permissions-overview">Roles &amp; Permissions Overview</h1>

<p>Roles and Permissions are used in tandem to control what users can see and do in your community. Upon account creation, there are 6 default Roles in your Vanilla account. Each of the default Roles have permissions that you would expect from the Role name:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Guest</strong>: This is a special role that represents inactive sessions in Vanilla. You can use this role to restrict what logged out users see when viewing your forum. As Vanilla does not allow anonymous posting, this role cannot be given other permissions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unconfirmed</strong>: This Role is given to members who have registered but have not confirmed their email address yet.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Applicant</strong>: Users who have applied for membership but have not yet been accepted. They have the same permissions as guests.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Member</strong>: Members can participate in discussions and access all end user functionality.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Moderators have permission to edit content and use the moderation features.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Administrator</strong>: Administrators have permission to do everything including configuring the account and creating new Roles.</p></li>
</ul>

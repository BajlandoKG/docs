<h2 id="disabling-badges">Disabling badges</h2>

<p>To disable a badge and prevent it from displaying publicly, click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the badge&rsquo;s row under the &ldquo;Active&rdquo; column. That will toggle it to &ldquo;No&rdquo;, indicating it is no longer active.  Inactive badges remain awarded to any users that received it previously. You can re-enable them by clicking &ldquo;No&rdquo;, which will then toggle back to &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, indicating it is active again.</p>

<p>It is not currently possible to delete a badge entirely.</p>

<h2 id="editing-a-badge">Editing a badge</h2>

<p>You can safely edit the Name, Description, and/or Image of any badge without effecting its automated functionality. These will be updated for any users who previously received the badge as well.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Slug&rdquo; field is what shows in the URL for the badge&rsquo;s page. It is its unique identifier. Changing a badge&rsquo;s Slug will cause it to be disassociated with any automation assigned to it. Therefore, <em>do not change the Slug of the Badges that come with Vanilla by default</em>.</p>

<p>You may change the Points for a badge at any time. Point changes are not retroactive for users who previously received it.</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-own-badges">Creating your own badges</h2>

<p>Create a memorable Name for your badge and give it a Description that explains what it is for and how users can earn it. This information will appear on the Badge&rsquo;s page.</p>

<p>The Slug should consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The Slug must be unique for each badge.</p>

<p>Add a 200x200 PNG for the image.</p>

<p>All badges created in your Dashboard must be given manually.</p>

<h2 id="creating-automated-badges">Creating automated badges</h2>

<p>It is not currently possible to create your own automated badges thru the Dashboard. To discuss custom possibilities for your community, contact sales.</p>

<p>##Dashboard</p>

<p>The Administration Panel, known as the Dashboard, provides access to the control features of your Vanilla Forum. Each Administration Panel is presented in sections, the header, the main navigation, the work area, and the footer. The top portion of all Panels, the header, is featured in a dark blue gradient. The header shows the name of your forum as a link to your forum&rsquo;s main page, a profile link (shown as your user name), and Sign Out.</p>

<p>On the left side of the screen is the main navigation menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Within each major function, such as Appearance, a list of sub-menu items appear, certain sub-menu items may vary depending on what addons you have installed.</p>

<p>The large area to the right of the screen is the work area. It is here the specific information relating to a particular navigation choice, such as adding a new post, is presented and collected.</p>

<p>Finally, in the footer, at the bottom of each Administration Panel also in a dark blue gradient, are links to Vanilla Forums, and Documentation. In addition, the version of Vanilla Forums you have installed can be found.</p>
